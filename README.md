> **Disclaimer**: This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** and prototype implementation. It is intended for research and educational purposes only. The code has not been audited and should not be used in production environments with real assets.

A privacy-preserving payment system for the Stellar network using zero-knowledge proofs. This implementation enables users to deposit, transfer, and withdraw tokens while maintaining transaction privacy through Groth16 proofs.

The system incorporates **Administrative Service Providers (ASPs)** as a control mechanism to provide illicit activity safeguards through association sets. ASPs maintain membership and non-membership Merkle trees that allow proving whether specific deposits are part of approved or blocked sets, enabling pool operators to enforce administrative controls without compromising user privacy.

## Features

- **Private Transactions**: Deposit, transfer, and withdraw tokens without revealing transaction amounts or sender/receiver relationships
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Groth16 proofs generated via Circom circuits
- **Administrative Controls**: ASP-based membership and non-membership proofs for illicit activity safeguards
- **Browser-Based Proving**: Client-side proof generation using WebAssembly
- **Stellar Integration**: Built on Soroban smart contracts

## Demo Application
The demo application consists on three main parts:
- **Frontend**: Provides a nice user interface for interacting with the system. 
- **Circuits**: Where the real zk-magic happens and constraints are defined.
- **Smart Contracts**: They define the state of the system, and how transactions are processed.

If you want to try it out:

1. Install dependencies
    ```bash
      make install
    ``` 
   

2. Compile the project, including circuit tests:
    ```bash
      make circuits-build # or BUILD_TESTS=1 cargo build
    ```
   

3. Deploy the contracts to a Stellar network:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy.sh <network> \                   # e.g. testnet
      --deployer <identity> \                         # Must be added in stellar-cli keys
      --asp-levels 8 \                                # Number of levels in the ASP trees
      --pool-levels 8 \                               # Number of levels in the pool Merkle tree
      --max-deposit 1000000000 \                      # Maximum deposit amount (in Stroops)
      --vk-file ./verification_key.json               # Verification key file (should be generated by circuits build in scripts/testdata)
    ```
   If you already have deployed contracts, make sure their addresses are updated in `scripts/deployments.json`.

4. Serve frontend
    ```bash
      make serve
    ```
    Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. You might want to open the console (_Shift + Ctrl + I_) to see the logs.
    You might need to delete the browser cache from previous runs. Go to `Application` -> `Clear storage`.


5. The pool is ready to use. But you will need to populate the ASP membership smart contracts with some public keys. You can do it directly from the stellar-cli:
    ```bash
    stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --source-account <ASP_ADMIN_ACCOUNT> -- insert_leaf --leaf <LEAF_VALUE> # See circuit for leaf format
    ```
    Or, direcly access `http://localhost:8080/admin.html` and use the UI to add public keys.
    Please note that the adming UI allows deriving keys for ANY account.
    But insertion MUST be signed by the ASP admin account.
    You can add your Freighter account to your Stellar-cli keys with `stellar keys add <NAME_FOR_ACCOUNT> --seed-phrase`.
    This will prompt you to type your seed phrase and will enable you to deploy contracts with the same account you have on your browser wallet.


6. Go back to `http://localhost:8080` and try it out!

### Architecture Overview

#### Transaction Flow

1. **Deposit**: User deposits tokens into the pool, creating a commitment (UTXO). No input notes are spent, creates output notes.
2. **Withdraw**: User proves ownership of commitments and withdraws tokens. Inputs notes are spent, no output notes are created.
3. **Transfer**: User spends existing commitments and creates new ones, all done privately.  Input notes are spent, and output notes under a new public key are created.
4. **Transact**: Enables advanced users with experience on privacy-preserving protocols to generate their own transactions. Spending, creating and transferring notes at will.

#### Zero-Knowledge Circuits

The main transaction circuit proves:
- Ownership of input UTXOs (knowledge of private keys)
- Correct nullifier computation (prevents double-spending)
- Valid Merkle proofs for input commitments
- Correct output commitment computation
- Balance conservation (inputs = outputs + public amount)
- ASP membership/non-membership proofs

#### Smart Contracts

- **Pool**: Main contract handling deposits, transfers, and withdrawals
- **Circom Groth16 Verifier**: On-chain verification of ZK proofs
- **ASP Membership**: Merkle tree of approved public keys
- **ASP Non-Membership**: Sparse Merkle tree for exclusion proofs

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.92.0 or later (see `rust-toolchain.toml`).
- **Circom** 2.2.2 or later for circuit compilation.
- **Stellar CLI** for contract deployment.
- **Node.js** for frontend dependencies.
- **wasm-pack** for building WASM modules.
- **Trunk** for serving the web application.

## Building and testing crates

### Building Circuits
To explicitly build them:

```bash
# Build circuits
cargo build -p circuits
```

The circuit crate also exposes 2 flags:
- **BUILD_TESTS**: Builds the circom test circuits. Most Circom circuits simply define a template. And if you want to use it or test it, you need to instantiate it with some specific parameters.
For efficiency, the compilation of these circuits test is gatekeeped behind this flag. When enabled, if the verifying keys are not in `scripts/testdata`, it will generate them.
- **REGEN_KEYS**: Forces the generation of new verification keys, even if they already exist. Should not generally be used, as it might cause issues with deployed contracts.

Also, for efficiency reasons, some tests are ignored by default. To run them:
```bash
# Test circuits requires the flag to be enabled
BUILD_TESTS=1 cargo test -p circuits -- --ignored
```
### Building Contracts

```bash
# Build all contracts
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package pool
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package asp-membership
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package asp-non-membership
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package circom-groth16-verifier

# Or use the deployment script which builds automatically
./scripts/deploy.sh --help
```

### Deploying Contracts
You can use the script `scripts/deploy.sh` to deploy contracts to a Stellar network.
An example can be found in the _Demo Application_ section..

See `./scripts/deploy.sh --help` for all options.


### End-to-End Tests

The E2E tests generate real Groth16 proofs and verify them, locally, using contracts and the Soroban-SDK. To run them:
```bash
cargo test -p e2e-tests
```

### JavaScript Tests

```bash
cd app
npm test
```

## Limitations

As a proof of concept, this implementation has several limitations:

- **No Groth16 Ceremony**: The Common Reference String (CRS) was not generated doing a decentralized ceremony.
- **Single circuit support**: Now the demo only showcases a single circuit (2 inputs, 2 outputs). Support for multiple circuits might be added in the future.
- **No Stellar Events**: The demo relies heavily on Stellar events. But RPC nodes only store events for a small retention window (7 days). This means that the demo will not work for longer periods of time. It requires a dedicated indexer serving events to users.
- **Decimal support**: Demo supports Stroops, so it should be able to handle XLM deposits with decimal amounts. But this has not been tested in the UI.
- **Not Audited**: The code has not undergone security audits.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling may not cover all edge cases.
