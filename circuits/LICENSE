# Licensing and Legal Nuances

## Primary License
The source code in this directory is licensed under the *Apache 2.0*, consistent with the rest of the repository. The only exception is the `build.rs` file.

## Dependencies and Exceptions

### 1. Build Scripts (`build.rs`)

The `build.rs` file included in this crate utilizes dependencies (`https://github.com/iden3/circom`) licensed under *GPLv3*.

* *Status:* While `build.rs` itself is subject to *GPLv3* due to these linkings, it is used strictly as a build-time tool.

* *No Contamination:* The `build.rs` script is not compiled into the final project binaries or artifacts. Its *GPLv3* licensing does not extend to the crate's main source code or the generated build artifacts.

### 2. Circom Circuits (files with `.circom` extension)

The circuit files in this directory import templates from `circomlib`, which is licensed under *LGPLv3*.

* *Source Status:* The circuit source code files written in this repository are provided under *Apache 2.0*. You are free to use, modify, and distribute these source templates under those terms.

* *Combined Works:* When these circuits are compiled (into `.r1cs` and `.wasm` files), the resulting artifacts effectively statically link against `circomlib`. Any distribution of these compiled artifacts must comply with *LGPLv3* terms (which primarily requires allowing the user to re-link/re-compile with a modified version of `circomlib`). The build process puts these files into a distribution directory `dist` (not included in the version control).

* *Compatibility:* Linking *Apache 2.0* source code with an *LGPLv3* library is a legally supported configuration.
