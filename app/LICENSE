## Clarification

The source code contained within this directory (`app/`) is licensed under the 
*Apache 2.0*.

This frontend application is designed to interact with compiled 
circuit artifacts (specifically WASM modules) at runtime.

### 1. Separation of Concerns

The circuit artifacts are NOT present in this source directory. They are 
generated during the build process and placed into the final distribution 
directory (`dist/`).

### 2. Dynamic Linking of *LGPLv3* Components

The loaded WASM artifacts are compiled from circuit templates that may link 
against `circomlib`, which is licensed under *LGPLv3*.

The interaction between this frontend application and the WASM artifacts is 
strictly *Dynamic Linking*:
* The application loads the artifacts as external modules via standard 
    WebAssembly interfaces.
* The application does not statically include, inline, or derive source code 
    from the *LGPLv3* circuit templates.

Therefore, under the terms of the *LGPLv3*, this frontend application is 
considered a "work that uses the library." The frontend source code remains 
under *Apache 2.0*, while the dynamically loaded WASM artifacts remain under 
*LGPLv3*.
